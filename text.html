  <h3>Early history</h3>
  Samguk Sagi, a historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, also mentions the pickle jar used to ferment vegetables, which indicates that fermented vegetables were commonly eaten during this time. During the Silla dynasty (57 BC – AD 935), kimchi became prevalent as Buddhism caught on throughout the nation and fostered a vegetarian
  lifestyle.
  <br>
  The pickling of vegetables was an ideal method, prior to refrigerators, that helped to preserve the lifespan of foods.<br>
  In Korea, kimchi was made during the winter by fermenting vegetables, and burying it in the ground in traditional brown ceramic pots called onggi. This labor further allowed a bonding among women within the family. 
  <br>A poem on Korean radish written by Yi Gyubo, a 13th-century literatus, shows that radish kimchi was a commonplace in Goryeo
  (918–1392).
  <br><br>
  Pickled radish slices make a good summer side-dish,
  Radish preserved in salt is a winter side-dish from start to end.
  The roots in the earth grow plumper every day,
  Harvesting after the frost, a slice cut by a knife tastes like a pear.
  <br>
  — Yi Gyubo, Donggukisanggukjip (translated by Michael J. Pettid, in Korean cuisine: An Illustrated History)
  <br><br>
  Kimchi has been a staple in Korean culture, but historical versions were not a spicy dish. Early records of kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper. Chili peppers, now a standard ingredient in kimchi, had been unknown in Korea until the early seventeenth century due to its being a New World crop. Chili peppers, originally native to the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders. The first mention of chili pepper is found in Jibong yuseol, an encyclopedia published in 1614. Sallim gyeongje, a 17‒18th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers. However, it was not until the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi was widespread. The recipes from early 19th century closely resemble today's kimchi.
  <br><br>
  A 1766 book, Jeungbo sallim gyeongje, reports kimchi varieties made with myriad ingredients, including chonggak-kimchi (kimchi made with chonggak radish), oi-sobagi (with cucumber), seokbak-ji (with jogi-jeot), and dongchimi.<br> However, napa cabbage was introduced to Korea only at the end of 19th century, and whole-cabbage kimchi similar toits current form is described in Siuijeonseo, a cookbook published around that time.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Modern history</h3>
  During South Korea's involvement in the Vietnam War the industrialization and commercialization of kimchi production
  became increasingly important because the Korean government wanted to provide rations for its troops. The Korean
  government requested American help to ensure that South Korean troops, reportedly "desperate" for the food, could obtain
  it in the field.
  <br><br>
  In 2008, South Korean scientists created a special low-calorie, vitamin-rich "space kimchi" for Yi So-yeon, the first Korean astronaut, to take to space. It was bacteria-free, unlike normal Kimchi in which bacteria are essential for fermentation. It was feared that cosmic rays might mutate the bacteria.
  <br><br>
  South Korea developed programs for adult Korean adoptees to return to South Korea and learn about what it means to be Korean. One of these programs was learning how to make kimchi.
  <br><br>
  <h3>1996 kimchi standard dispute with Japan</h3>
  In 1996, Korea protested against Japanese commercial production of kimchi arguing that the Japanese-produced product
  (kimuchi, キムチ) was different from kimchi. In particular, Japanese kimchi was not fermented and more similar to asazuke.
  Korea lobbied for an international standard from the Codex Alimentarius, an organization associated with the World
  Health Organization that defines voluntary standards for food preparation for international trade purposes.
  In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as "a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature", but which neither specified a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbade the use of any additives.
  Following the inclusion of the kimchi standard, kimchi exports in Korea did increase, but so did the production of
  kimchi in China and the import of Chinese kimchi into Korea.
  <br><br>
  <h3>2010 Kimchi ingredient price crisis</h3>
  Due to heavy rainfall shortening the harvesting time for cabbage and other main ingredients for kimchi in 2010, the
  price of kimchi ingredients and kimchi itself rose greatly. Korean and international newspapers described the rise in prices as a national crisis. Some restaurants stopped offering kimchi as a free side dish, which The New York Times compared to an American hamburger restaurant no longer offering free ketchup. In response to the kimchi price crisis, the South Korean government announced the temporary reduction of tariffs on imported cabbage to coincide with the kimjang season.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity</h3>
  Kimchi-related items have been inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by both South and North Korea. This makes kimchi the second intangible heritage that was submitted by two countries, the other one being the folk song "Arirang" which was also submitted by both the Koreas.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Submitted by South Korea (inscribed 2013)</h3>
  Kimjang, the tradition of making and sharing kimchi that usually takes place in late autumn, was added to the list as "Gimjang, making and sharing kimchi in the Republic of Korea". The practice of Gimjang reaffirms Korean identity and strengthens family cooperation. Gimjang is also an important reminder for many Koreans that human communities need to live in harmony with nature.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Submitted by North Korea (inscribed 2015)</h3>
  North Korean kimchi-making was inscribed on the list in December 2015 as "Tradition of kimchi-making in the
  Democratic People's Republic of Korea". North Korean kimchi tends to be less spicy and red than South Korean
  kimchi. Seafood is used less often and less salt is added. Additional sugar is used to help with fermentation in the cold climate.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Kimchi Day</h3>
  In the United States, states California, Virginia, Maryland and New York, and capital city Washington D.C. have issued proclamations declaring November 22 as 'Kimchi Day' to recognize the importance of the dish as part of Korean culture.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Conflicts with China</h3>
  <h4>2012 effective ban by China of Korean kimchi imports</h4>
  Since 2012, the Chinese government has effectively banned the import of Korean kimchi through government regulations.
  <br>
  Ignoring the standards of kimchi outlined by the Codex Alimentarius, China defined kimchi as a derivative of one of its own cuisines, called pao cai.[54] However, due to significantly different preparation techniques from pao cai, kimchi has significantly more lactic acid bacteria through its fermentation process, which exceeds China's regulations.
  <br>
  Since 2012, commercial exports of Korean kimchi to China has reached zero; the only minor amounts of exports accounting
  for Korean kimchi are exhibition events held in China.[54]
  <br><br>
  <h4>Boycott in China</h4>
  A 2017 article in The New York Times said that anti-Korean sentiment in China has risen after South Korea's acceptance of the deployment of THAAD in South Korea, government-run Chinese news media has encouraged the boycott of South Korean goods, and Chinese nationalists have vowed to not eat kimchi. The move was criticized by other Chinese nationalists, who noted that China officially considered Koreans an integral ethnic group in the multinational state, and that kimchi is also indigenous to the Koreans in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. Chinese nationalists have also criticized Korean kimchi, by calling them "merely pickles", whereas Chinese kimchi pao cai's literal meaning is "pickled vegetable".
  <br><br>
  <h4>2020 kimchi origin dispute with China</h4>
  In November 2020, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) posted new regulations for the making of pao cai. The same month, BBC News reported that Chinese news organization Global Times claimed the new ISO standard was "an international standard for the kimchi industry led by China".This sparked strong anger from South Korean media and people, as well as the responses from some Chinese people who argued China held the
  right to claim Kimchi as their own.
  <br><br>
  After the controversy emerged, Global Times explained the controversy as the "misunderstanding in translation", and
  stated that "Kimchi refers to a kind of fermented cabbage dish that plays an integral role in Korean cuisine, while
  paocai, or Sichuan paocai, refers to pickled vegetables that are popular originally in Southwest China's Sichuan
  Province, but now in most parts of northern China." Global Times also reported that Baidu Baike, the Chinese online encyclopedia, removed the controversial phrase "Korean kimchi originated from China" after the request. The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism subsequently presented the guidelines to set the term "xin qi" as the new proper Chinese translation of Kimchi while "pao cai" was an acceptable translation prior to the controversy.

Kimchi is one of the most important staples of Korean cuisine. The Korean term "Kimchi" refers to fermented vegetables,
and encompasses salt and seasoned vegetables. It is mainly served as a side dish with every meal, but also can be served as a main dish. Kimchi is mainly recognized as a spicy fermented cabbage dish globally.
<br><br>
New variations of kimchi continue to be created, and the taste can vary depending on the region and season.
Conventionally, the secret of kimchi preparation was passed down by mothers to their daughters in a bid to make them
suitable wives to their husbands. However, with the current technological advancement and increase in social media
use, many individuals worldwide can now access the recipe for kimchi preparation. It is highly nutritious and offers
deeply-flavored and spicy meals favorable to many classes of people, and illustrates the Korean culture as well.
<br><br>
Kimchi can be categorized by main ingredients, regions or seasons. Korea's northern and southern sections have a considerable temperature difference. There are over 180 recognized varieties of kimchi. The most common kimchi
variations are
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Baechu-kimchi (배추김치) spicy napa cabbage kimchi, made from whole cabbage leaves</li>
  <li>Baechu-geotjeori (배추겉절이) unfermented napa cabbage kimchi
  </li>
  <li>Bossam-kimchi (보쌈김치) wrapped kimchi</li>
  <li>Baek-kimchi (백김치) white kimchi, made without chili pepper</li>
  <li>Dongchimi (동치미) a non-spicy watery kimchi</li>
  <li>Nabak-kimchi (나박김치) a mildly spicy watery kimchi</li>
  <li>Chonggak-kimchi (총각김치) cubed chonggak "ponytail" radish, a popular spicy kimchi</li>
  <li>Kkakdugi (깍두기) spicy cubed Korean radish strongly-scented kimchi containing fermented shrimp</li>
  <li>Oi-sobagi (오이소박이) cucumber kimchi that can be stuffed with seafood and chili paste, and is a popular choice during the
  spring and summer seasons</li>
  <li>Pa-kimchi (파김치) spicy green onion kimchi</li>
  <li>Yeolmu-kimchi (열무김치) is also a popular choice during the spring and summer, and is made with yeolmu radishes, and does
  not necessarily have to be fermented.</li>
  <li>Gat-kimchi (갓김치), made with Indian mustard</li>
  <li>Yangbaechu-kimchi (양배추 김치) spicy cabbage kimchi, made from "headed" cabbage leaves (as opposed to napa cabbage)</li>

    <a href="#Top">TOP</a><br>
    The following regional classification dates to the 1960s. Since then, kimchi-making practices and trends in Korea have
    diverged from it.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pyongan-do (North Korea, outside of Pyongyang): Non-traditional ingredients have been adopted in rural areas due to severe food shortages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hamgyeong-do (Upper Northeast): Due to its proximity to the ocean, people in this particular region use fresh fish and oysters to season their kimchi.
      </li>
      <li> 
        Hwanghae-do (Midwest): The taste of kimchi in Hwanghae-do is not bland but not extremely spicy. Most kimchi from this region has less color since red chili flakes are not used. The typical kimchi for Hwanghae-do is called hobakji (호박지).It is made with pumpkin (bundi).
      </li>
      <li>
        Gyeonggi-do (Lower Midwest of Hwanghae-do)
      </li>
      <li> 
        Chungcheong-do (between Gyeonggi-do and Jeolla-do): Instead of using fermented fish, people in the region rely on salt and fermentation to make savory kimchi. Chungcheong-do has the most varieties of kimchi.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gangwon-do (South Korea)/Kangwon-do (North Korea) (Mideast): In Gangwon-do, kimchi is stored for longer periods. Unlike other coastal regions in Korea, kimchi in this area does not contain much salted fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jeolla-do (Lower Southwest): Salted yellow corvina and salted butterfish are used in this region to create different seasonings for kimchi.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gyeongsang-do (Lower Southeast): This region's cuisine is saltier and spicier. The most common seasoning components include myeolchijeot (멸치젓) which produce a briny and savory flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Foreign countries: In some places of the world people sometimes make kimchi with western cabbage and many other alternative ingredients such as broccoli.

  <article class = "Seasonal variations">
    <hr>
    <h2><a id="Seasonal variations">Seasonal variations</a></h2>
    <a href="#Top">TOP</a><br>
    Different types of kimchi were traditionally made at different times of the year, based on when various vegetables were in season and also to take advantage of hot and cold seasons before the era of refrigeration. Although the advent of modern refrigeration – including kimchi refrigerators specifically designed with precise controls to keep different varieties of kimchi at optimal temperatures at various stages of fermentation – has made this seasonality unnecessary,
    Koreans continue to consume kimchi according to traditional seasonal preferences.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Spring</h3>
    After a long period of consuming gimjang kimchi (김장김치) during the winter, fresh potherbs and vegetables were used to
    make kimchi. These kinds of kimchi were not fermented or even stored for long periods of time but were consumed fresh.
    <br>

    <h3>Summer</h3>
    Yeolmu radishes and cucumbers are summer vegetables made into kimchi, yeolmu-kimchi (열무김치) which is eaten in several
    bites. Brined fish or shellfish can be added, and freshly ground dried chili peppers are often used.
    <br>

    <h3>Autumn</h3>
    Baechu kimchi is prepared by inserting blended stuffing materials, called sok (literally inside), between layers of
    salted leaves of uncut, whole Napa cabbage. The ingredients of sok (속) can vary, depending on the regions and weather
    conditions. Generally, baechu kimchi used to have a strong salty flavor until the late 1960s, before which a large
    amount of myeolchijeot or saeujeot had been used.
    <br>
    Gogumasoon Kimchi is made from sweet potato stems.
    <br>

    <h3>Winter</h3>
    Traditionally, the greatest varieties of kimchi were available during the winter. In preparation for the long winter months, many types of kimjang kimchi (김장 김치) were prepared in early winter and stored in the ground in large kimchi pots. Today, many city residents use modern kimchi refrigerators offering precise temperature controls to store kimjang kimchi. November and December are traditionally when people begin to make kimchi; women often gather together in each
    other's homes to help with winter kimchi preparations. "Baechu kimchi" is made with salted baechu filled with thin strips of radish, parsley, pine nuts, pears, chestnuts, shredded red pepper, manna lichen (Korean: 석이 버섯; RR: seogi
    beoseot), garlic, and ginger.<br><br>

  <article class = "Korean preference">
    <hr>
    <h2><a id="Korean preference">Korean preference</a></h2>
    <a href="#Top">TOP</a><br>
    As of 2004, the preference of kimchi preparation in Korean households from the most prepared type of kimchi to less prepared types of kimchi was: baechu kimchi, being the most prepared type of kimchi, then kkakdugi, then dongchimi and
    then chonggak kimchi. Baechu kimchi comprised more than seventy percent of marketed kimchi and radish kimchi comprised
    about twenty percent of marketed kimchi.
